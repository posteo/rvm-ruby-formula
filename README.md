# RVM - Ruby - Formula

This salt formula lets you install several Ruby versions for a specific user through RVM. It will automatically install RVM for you before installing any Ruby version. This module uses the default salt RVM state (https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/states/all/salt.states.rvm.html), but frees you from adding a lengthy custom state definition as described in the official salt documentation.
